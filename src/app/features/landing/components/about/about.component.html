                    <p class="c4-txt-3">I started Re-Connect to bring together people who care deeply about helping others make smart financial decisions when buying real estate. My crusade to accomplish this was born out of heartbreaking experiences. You see, many times I had people come to my office looking for help that I couldn’t give them due to failed transactions from other lenders, and people dropping the ball. More than once I sat there, feeling helpless as they would cry and pour their heart out because they had lost every dollar of their savings. None of that would have happened if they just had the right knowledge or the right people looking out for them. It was unacceptable, and I vowed to find a solution. My unique background was the catalyst I needed to put this all together.<br><br> Then Re-Connect was born and is the ONLY real estate name on the planet that genuinely empowers property buyers to make smarter financial decisions based on true affordability. I partner with property buyers from all walks of life to lower the chances of lost deals and make sure those months of hard work culminate to fruition. I’ve spent years developing a never-before-seen system that significantly reduces the chances of pre-approval failure, with uncompromised support from a dedicated home buying team.</p>
